# Datastructure-Algorithms

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey — including solved problems, explanations, and optimized solutions from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeStudio, GeeksforGeeks and more.

🔹 What’s Inside?

        🧠  Core Data Structures (Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs)

        🔢 Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Recursion, DP, Greedy, Backtracking)

        💡 Multiple Approaches: Brute Force → Optimized

        📝 Well-commented code with time & space complexity

🎯 Goal: Strengthen problem-solving & coding interview skills

🛠️ Tech Stack:  Python

📈 Progress:  Continuous updates as I practice new problems and explore deeper concepts.
